How should we water new sodding?
Water your new sod daily for the first 2-3 weeks depending on the weather. Then water your sodding every 2 days for another 2-3 weeks. Deep root watering is required. Pull up a corner of a roll of sod and inspect it to see if it the water has penetrated the sod. To ensure it has received enough water, you can also put your foot down and hear and feel if it is squishy. Yes, squishy, squishy is good. Most people do not water it enough and this is the reason most lawns do not take. The newly severed roots have to be kept very moist.
