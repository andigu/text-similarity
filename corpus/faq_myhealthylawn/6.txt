Why is my lawn still brown in early spring?
If you have been looking at everyone's green lawn in the spring and your lawn is still brown and looking not too healthy, it is possibly new Kentucky Blue Grass sodding. Kentucky Blue Grass needs warm temperature to perk up and look nice and green. Most sod that is available and laid is Kentucky Blue Grass unfortunately.
So to remedy this issue simply start overseeding with Fescue lawn seed. It is also called shade grass or Eco grass, you will eventually get a better lawn mixture of grass seed for our temperatures and your lawn will look as green as everyone's else in April and May.
