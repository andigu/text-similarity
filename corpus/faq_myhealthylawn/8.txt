What is deep root watering ?
If you want strong grass roots that will grow more grass blades you need to be watering your lawn for a long time once or twice a week only. Not short spurts every day. Daily watering will likely lead to moss growing in areas that get a lot of shade. The ground never gets a chance to dry out. With daily watering your grass roots will stay short, because they do not need to grown deep to search for water.
