Do you offer weekly lawn cutting?
We do cut a few lawns, but only very selectively in Mineola and Port Credit.  We do not actively look for new customers but may consider a client who would want all their seasonal services with us, ie. spring/fall cleanup, lawn fertilizing, hedge and shrub trimming, overseeding, mulching, gardening and snow removal.  We would not take on any new customer just for their lawn cutting.
