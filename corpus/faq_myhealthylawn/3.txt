Do you provide lawn weed killing?
It is very difficult to kill most weeds with what is available on the market to spray. A few people have lawns with lots of weeds and unfortunately we cannot help them. We are able to only help control a few types of weeds. So if you want us to go by and kill all your weeds, the answer is no, I am very sorry.
