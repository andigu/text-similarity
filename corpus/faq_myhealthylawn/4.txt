How to water a new tree or shrub?
One you have planted your tree or shrub, water it well once a week remembering the water has to get to the bottom of the root ball you just planted.
Do not water it too much during normal weather conditions.
Watering only the surface of the plant will encourage plants to develop surface roots, which will weaken the shrub.
Take your time watering them to ensure the water is being absorbed by the plant and the water is not running off to the sides.
Water in the morning to allow leaves to dry because Wet leaves and cool temperatures may promote a plant disease.
