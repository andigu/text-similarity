Why does ezhome have gardeners as employees vs contractors?
Working with employees instead of contractors allows us to take better care of your yard and give you the peace of mind that comes from reliable, secure work. We only hire gardeners who are legally able to work, have clean driving records, and clear background checks.In addition, we provide our employees with worker's compensation insurance and ongoing training to give you consistently excellent results--something we couldn't do with contractors.
