Does ezhome service commercial properties?
While we primarily service residential homes, we're happy to serve your commercial property if it meets the following conditions:You're fine with service occurring weekdays between 7:30 am and 4 pm.Your property is small enough that one gardener can service it in under two hours.We can leave debris in green bins or on the street without needing to haul it away.You can pay by credit card or ACH.We use blowers in much of our work, so keep in mind any noise concerns you may have during business hours.
