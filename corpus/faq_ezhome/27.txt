When and how will I be billed for ezhome services?
You'll be charged on the first Monday of each service period. Billing in advance helps us schedule your maintenance team and provide you with consistent service. Charges for any additional services that you purchase will be applied at the time of service.To make your billing more convenient, you can also use your ezhome account to verify your charges!
