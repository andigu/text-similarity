Why would I need an initial cleanup?
If it's been awhile since you used a gardening service, we will probably need to do an Initial Cleanup Service before we can begin regular maintenance visits.During this initial cleanup, we'll send a specialized crew to work on problem areas in your yard (such as excessive weeds or leaf debris build-up). This cleanup is essential before our regular maintenance crews can start working. There is an additional fee for this service, but we will send you a quote in advance so you don't get charged for any services you don't want.
