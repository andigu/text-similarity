Will I still get service when it rains or shortly after it rains?
We'll do as much as we can, but we won't be able to mow your lawn or use blowers during heavy rain or when your yard is very wet. During wet weather, we'll take care of other tasks, such as monitoring your yard for drainage issues and cleaning your hardscape and entryway.Please remember that ezhome is an annual plan, so the occasional limited service or no-service day won't impact your total costs. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact ezhome Support for more information.
