What is your cancellation/refund policy if I need to discontinue service?
You can cancel your service at the end of any billing cycle, as long as you do so at least 48 hours before your next scheduled visit and/or the start of a new billing cycle. We will still provide any services you have already prepaid for after you discontinue.
