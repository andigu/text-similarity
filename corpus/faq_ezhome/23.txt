When is the right time to prune my trees and shrubs?
The best time to do any major pruning is late winter, when your plants are dormant. This way, the pruning won't negatively affect your trees' future growth.Stone-fruit trees are the one exception to this rule. These trees should be pruned during warmer and drier weather, as these weather conditions help them heal faster. You can also cut out dead twigs or remove overhanging branches year-round.
