Can I put my services on hold while I'm on vacation?
While you do have the option to put your service on hold when you go on vacation, we don't recommend it. After all, your plants will continue to grow while you are away. If access restrictions will prevent us from servicing your yard, please let us know at least 48 hours before your next scheduled service.Please note that we can't discount your hold period from your monthly fees since we would need to do extra work when you return and keep your spot on our schedule while you're gone.
