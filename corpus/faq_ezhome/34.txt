How long do I need to keep my kids and pets away after your weed spray application?
We recommend that you keep your kids and pets out of treated areas until the spray has dried. The weed control herbicide we primarily use contains Glyphosate, which is considered safe as soon as it is dry. Keep in mind that the dry time will vary between sunny and overcast days.
