Can you accommodate preferences for service on a specific day of the week?
Definitely! You can let us know which days you would prefer service when you sign up online. We currently only offer weekday services, but we'll do our best to service you on your preferred day of the week. Remember, you don't need to be home during your gardener's visit!
