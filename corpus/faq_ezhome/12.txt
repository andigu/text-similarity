Are there tasks I should not ask gardeners to do?
We do our best to meet your needs, but there are some tasks that are too dangerous or require extra training that our gardeners don't have. These are a few of the services we currently can't provide: Pest controlElectrical workHardscape workWater feature careTraditional cleaning tasksIn addition, your gardener can't take care of vegetable beds or potted plants, as these require more frequent and specialized care than our weekly or bi-weekly visits allow.
