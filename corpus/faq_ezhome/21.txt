What are the benefits of aeration and when should it be done?
Aeration improves the health of your grass by punching small holes in your lawn to allow air, water and other nutrients to reach the root system. For best results, you should aerate your lawn twice a year--once in the spring and once in the fall. Contact ezhome Support if you'd like to learn more about this service!
