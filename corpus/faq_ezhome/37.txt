Will my gardener be the same every visit?
The same gardener will typically work on your property each visit (unless they're sick or on vacation). We will periodically send additional specialists for enhancements and quality inspections, but otherwise, you can expect to see the same team each week.Your gardener may change every once in awhile, but all of your information will be passed along so your new gardener will know exactly how to take care of your yard.
