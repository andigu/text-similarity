How should I select between Weekly and Bi-Weekly service?
In general, we recommend choosing the weekly service plan so we can keep your yard looking exactly how you want. However, a bi-weekly plan is a good alternative if you have a small yard with few plants. This low-cost option will provide lawn care and debris removal every other week.Keep in mind that choosing bi-weekly service will make it harder for your gardener to monitor and report any issues with your yard. Your garden will also look less-maintained between visits.
