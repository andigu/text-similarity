I don't have a lawn anymore, what service will ezhome provide?
If you replace the sod in your yard with gravel, hardscape, or other landscaping, we'll probably need to adjust your service plan! Let us know right away so we can update your property blueprint and adjust your service proposal.If your lawn has died but you still have sod in place, this won't affect your service cost. Your gardener will still mow your lawn for debris collection, and rain can always revive your lawn later on.
