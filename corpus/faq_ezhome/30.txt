How will you dispose of debris?
Our gardeners will put all organic debris in your green bins so it can be disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner. You might need to request extra green bins from your waste management company or purchase new bins online so you have sufficient disposal space during fall and winter.Where local regulations allow, our gardeners will also leave debris on the street for collection.
