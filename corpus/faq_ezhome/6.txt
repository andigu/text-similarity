Will ezhome service my flower beds, flower pots, and vegetable beds?
Yes! We will treat weeds in your flower beds as part of The Basics service. If you choose our Full Service package, we'll also take care of deadheading in your flower beds and flower pots.Unfortunately, we can't hand-water your flower pots or care for your vegetable beds. We don't want your plants to die, and they need more frequent care than we can provide with our weekly or bi-weekly visits.
