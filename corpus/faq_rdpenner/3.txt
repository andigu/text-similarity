Do you use pesticides or GMO plants?
As advocates of responsible IPM (Integrated Plant/Pest Management) we recommend the responsible, carefully controlled and regulated use of pesticides only as a last resort, and where such use can be justified due to risks to neighbouring properties or economic loss. We do not take the view that genetic modification of plants is in itself harmful or unethical, and in fact science has played an essential role in preventing the starvation of millions throughout the world. However, we are very happy to respect the views of our clients who want absolute assurance that their living space is developed according to their beliefs, including their definition of organic gardening.
