What services do you subcontract?
We are proud of the great working relationships we continue to develop with reputable local gardening centres, suppliers, landscapers and landscape designers, and other horticultural professionals. We typically sub or jointly contract services such as lawn care, tree removal and trimming, and major "hardscaping" (e.g. patio and pathway installations, retainer walls, etc.).  For some clients, our greatest benefit is to provide a single source point of service for the many different aspects of outdoor development and maintenance, such as sprinkler system installation.
