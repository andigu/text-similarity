Corpus used to train models:
Model 1: just faq and answers to those
Model 2: model 1 + other gardening websites
Model 3: model 2 + literature, etc much larger corpus
Model 4: model 3, but much more training on gardening vs other corpus (increased weighting on gardening stuff) 500 to 100

The word2vec model should be already trained - the most up to date one is model_4
